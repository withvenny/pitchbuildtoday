# 09. Web App to Mobile App

## Purpose

This step converts a web app build plan into mobile app direction.

The goal is to determine what, if anything, should become a mobile app and how the mobile experience should adapt from the web experience.

## Accepted Inputs

The agent may ingest the web app build plan from the previous step, along with route structure, page inventory, component plans, API integration notes, authentication behavior, state requirements, responsive needs, testing notes, deployment notes, and unresolved build questions.

The input should provide enough implementation clarity for the agent to identify what mobile-specific value may exist.

## Transformation

The agent is responsible for converting the web app plan into mobile app direction.

The agent should identify mobile use cases, native device needs, mobile-specific screens, navigation changes, push notification needs, offline behavior, app store requirements, platform differences, and whether a native app, hybrid app, PWA, or no mobile app is the right path.

## Output

The output is a mobile app plan that gives builders enough context to create or defer the mobile experience.

The mobile app plan should help a reader understand what should carry over from the web app, what needs to change for mobile, and whether mobile adds enough value to justify the build.

## Output Format

The preferred output may be saved as `.md`, `.tsx`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.ipa`, `.apk`, or another format suitable for review, implementation, packaging, and handoff.

The format should remain clear enough to support mobile builders, app store preparation, and future implementation decisions.

## Gate

This step is complete when the mobile direction, platform choice, mobile-specific features, app store needs, device capability requirements, and carryover from the web app can be understood without revisiting the full web app plan.

The process should not assume a mobile app is required when a responsive web app or PWA is enough.

## Agent

## Next Step

After the mobile app plan is created, the Pitch. Build. Today. workflow has completed the primary build-readiness sequence.

Use the final artifact set for implementation, review, funding conversations, technical handoff, or future iteration.
